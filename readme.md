Packages
--------

* **idle3-tools**
  A tool to set the idle3 flag on Western Digital Green hard disk drives.
  Normally you would need to connect a WD Green drive to a PC and run the
  original [WDIDLE3.EXE program](https://www.synology.com/en-uk/knowledgebase/faq/407)
  to set the idle timer, but with this Linux tool you can set in on the command
  line interface (CLI) directly after installing it via ipkg on the DiskStation.

Scripts
-------

* none for now
